## Tutorials
### Hello Wrold
- First you need set up the global config and Install as a Vue plugin, config must have pages option:
  ```js
  Vue.use(historyNavigationVue.plugin, {
    pages: [
      {
        path: '/',
        component: {
          template: '<h1>Hello Wrold!</h1>'
        }
      }
    ]
  });
  ```
- You will get a global component `<NavigationController>`. It's the **root container**. Put it in the template:
```js
new window.Vue({
  el: '#app',
  template: '<NavigationController />'
});
```

### Navigator
You will also get another global component: `<Navigator>`, With it, You can use it to jump between different pages.

Add a new page **/detail** and modify the `config.pages`:

```js{7,16}
[
  {
    path: '/',
    component: {
      template: `<div>
        <h1>Hello Wrold!</h1>
        <Navigator url="/detail">To Detail</Navigator>
      </div>`
    }
  },
  {
    path: '/detail',
    component: {
      template: `<div>
        <h1>Detail</h1>
        <Navigator type="back">Back</Navigator>
      </div>`
    }
  }
]
```
Finished!

### Transition
By default, this project comes with some transitions, It can make different effects according to different behaviors.
If you don’t like it, you can customize. We have a powerful CSS-based API. You can configure it globally, or you can set it every routing.
```html
<Navigator url="/foo" transition="some-custom">Foo</Navigator>
```
By the CSS-base API, It can also easily cooperate with third-party libraries such as [animate.css](https://animate.style/):
```css
.h-nav-behavior-replace> .my-ani {
  animation-duration: 1s;
}
.h-nav-behavior-replace > .my-ani > .h-nav-page-enter-active{
  animation-name: backInUp;
}
.h-nav-behavior-replace > .my-ani > .h-nav-page-leave-active{
  animation-name: backOutUp;
}
```
[Preview](https://hezedu.github.io/history-navigation-vue/examples/transition-with-amimate.html)

<!-- It can recognize `back` / `push` / `replace` behavior, and make corresponding effects. In addition, we also have some extended behaviors, Some of them have no transition by default(such as tab switching). You can enable it by writing CSS. We have a strong [CSS API](/api.html#transition-css). You can modify the default like this:
```css
.h-nav-behavior-push  > .h-nav-transition > .h-nav-page-leave-to,
.h-nav-behavior-back > .h-nav-transition > .h-nav-page-enter{
  left: -100%;
}
```
You can also set different transitions at will through the navigator:
```html
<Navigator url="/foo" transition="some-custom">Foo</Navigator>
```
It can also easily cooperate with third-party libraries such as [animate.css](https://animate.style/): -->
